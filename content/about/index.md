# About Me

Hey there! I’m **Badr**, a curious mind who loves tinkering with networks, securing systems, and automating the boring stuff. I’ve spent years diving into the world of **firewalls, cloud networking, and network access control (NAC)**, and I’m here to share what I’ve learned along the way.

This website is my playground for exploring ideas, building labs, and documenting my experiments. Whether it’s simulating complex networks with **ContainerLab**, automating security policies, or designing resilient cloud architectures, I’m all about making networks smarter, faster, and more secure.

## Why This Website?

I started this site to:
- **Share practical guides** on network security and automation.
- **Document my lab setups** and experiments—because breaking things is the best way to learn!
- **Explore new tools and technologies** that make networking and security more efficient.
- **Connect with others** who are passionate about building secure and scalable systems.

If you’re into networking, security, or automation, you’ll feel right at home here.

## What I’m Into

Here are some of the tools and topics I love working with:
- **Firewalls**: Designing and managing secure network boundaries.
- **Cloud Networking**: Building and securing networks in AWS, Azure, and GCP.
- **ContainerLab**: Simulating network topologies for testing and learning.
- **NAC (Network Access Control)**: Implementing policies to control who and what gets access to the network.
- **Automation**: Using tools like **Ansible**, **Python**, and **Terraform** to automate repetitive tasks and streamline operations.
- **Monitoring & Visualization**: Tools like **Grafana**, **Prometheus**, and **ELK Stack** to keep an eye on network performance and security.
- **AI in Security and Networking**: Exploring how AI can enhance threat detection, network optimization, and automation.
